## Documentation
Documentation for how to use Serial Loops can be found on [our website](https://haroohie.club/chokuretsu/serial-loops/).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
It is recommended that you use a distribution of Serial Loops that automatically installs or comes with the necessary prerequisites. For each platform these are:

* Linux: Flatpak (soon: from Flathub)
  - The AppImage, deb, and rpm packages are also good, but if you're not sure which to choose, go with the Flatpak
* macOS: Installer
* Windows: Installer

Using these will ensure Serial Loops is ready to use after installation. However, if you would rather use a portable build on Windows/Linux, please check the information on installing these prerequisites in the next section.

#### Dependencies for Non-Packages Releases
If you opt to use one of the non-packaged releases on Windows or Linux, you will need to install a few dependencies. These are:

* Clang and LLD from [LLVM](http://llvm.org) (on Windows, it's best to just use the LLVM installer as it will install both of these; on Linux, you can opt to install just the `clang` and `lld` packages from your package manager)
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
* On Linux, you will also need SDL2

#### A Nintendo DS Emulator
To test the game easily, you will want to have a Nintendo DS emulator installed. We recommend using [melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/) for its accuracy.

### Download & Install
Once you have installed any necessary prerequisites, to install Serial Loops, download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/haroohie-club/SerialLoops/releases).

Be sure to [read the Serial Loops documentation](https://haroohie.club/chokuretsu/serial-loops/docs) for instructions on how to use it!

### Uninstalling
Uninstalling Serial Loops itself is quite simple; however, you may also want to uninstall the packaged dependencies. Follow the instructions below for each platform to do this.

#### Linux
* If you installed the Flatpak, simply run `flatpak uninstall --delete-data club.haroohie.SerialLoops` to remove the Flatpak and all its associated data. If you don't want to keep your project data, ensure you delete the `~/SerialLoops` directory as well.
* If you installed the deb or rpm package, run your package manager's uninstall command for the `SerialLoops` package.
* If you downloaded the tarball, delete the unpacked files from your system. You may also run your package manager's uninstallation command for Clang, LLD, Ninja, and SDL2.

#### macOS
Simply drag the Serial Loops application from the Applications folder to the trash.

#### Windows
Go into Add or Remove Programs and remove Serial Loops and (if you don't want it anymore) LLVM.

## Bugs
Please file bugs in the Issues tab in this repository. Please include the following information:
* The platform you are running Serial Loops on
* The version of the _Chokuretsu_ ROM you are using (Japanese, patched English ROM, etc.)
* A description of the steps required to reproduce the issue
* The relevant logs for the issue (can be found in ~/SerialLoops/Logs)

## Development
### License
Serial Loops is licensed under the GPLv3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

### Prerequisites
Serial Loops requires the .NET 8.0 SDK to build. You can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

Additionally, on macOS, you will have to install CMake so that the build can compile SDL2. To do this, download the macOS dmg for your
[here](https://cmake.org/download/) and install it. Then run:
```bash
sudo /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install
```
This will symlink the CMake binaries to `/usr/local/bin` which is necessary for the build to work.

On Linux, you will need to install the SDL2 binaries for your distribution.

### Building
To build Serial Loops for your platform, run:
```bash
dotnet build
```
On Linux/Mac, you need to specify the target framework:
```bash
dotnet build -f net8.0
```
Specifying this prevents dotnet from trying to build the Windows project, which can cause errors.

We recommend [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for development as it has the best Avalonia support and is now free to use for non-commercial purposes; however, on Windows, you can also use [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
You can also build from both of these IDEs; however, when building from Rider on Linux/Mac, you must go into **Settings &rarr; Build, Execution, Deployment &rarr; Toolset and Build** and add `TargetFramework=net8.0`
to the MSBuild global properties field. This has the same effect as specifying `-f net8.0` on the command line.

If you'd like to contribute new features or fixes, we recommend [getting in touch on Discord first](https://discord.gg/nesRSbpeFM) before submitting a pull request!

### Testing
Serial Loops has headless tests that run to test the UI and other functionality of the program. To run tests locally, you will need to define either a `ui_vals.json` file or set an environment variable.

First, download [these test assets](https://haroohie.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/bootstrap/serial-loops/test-assets.zip) -OutFile $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/test-assets.zip) and unzip them to a directory somewhere. Then, specify that directory in the `ui_vals.json` as `AssetsDirectory` or set the environment variable `ASSETS_DIRECTORY` to that path.

Tests can be run via `dotnet test` (make sure to add `-f net8.0` on Linux or Mac) or through the test runners in Rider or Visual Studio.
